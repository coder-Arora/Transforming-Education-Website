        <p>Computer science education or computing education is the art of teaching and learning the discipline of computer science and computational thinking. As a subdiscipline of pedagogy it also addresses the wider impact of computer science in society through its intersection with philosophy, psychology, linguistics, natural sciences, and mathematics. In comparison to science education and mathematics education, computer science (CS) education is a much younger field. In the history of computing, digital computers were only built from around the 1940s although computation has been around for centuries since the invention of analog computers.

         <p>In every Learning Squared program, we seek to understand the level of change and impact that we have created, enabling us to allocate resources to programs with the highest impact and define how to improve that impact on a long and short-term basis. We look at quality-of-life metrics such as poverty and school attainment and access to quality and affordable education. The program created a platform for rural women, especially women whose children benefit from our rural scholarship program, to articulate their concerns, evaluate their accomplishments, and devise strategies to tackle challenges they may encounter. Under the program,  we established functional community structures with 10-15 members to address issues affecting women's livelihood and their children's education.

         <p>Another differentiator of computer science education is that it has primarily only been taught at university level until recently, with some notable exceptions in Israel, Poland and the United Kingdom with the BBC Micro in the 1980s as part of Computer science education in the United Kingdom. Computer science has been a part of the school curricula from age 14 or age 16 in a few countries for a few decades, but has typically as an elective Primary and secondary computer science education is relatively new in the United States with many K-12 CS teachers facing obstacles to integrating CS instruction such as professional isolation, limited CS professional development resources, and low levels of CS teaching self-efficacy. According to a 2021 report, only 51% of high schools in the US offer computer science.
